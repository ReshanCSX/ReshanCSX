# Hello, I'm Reshan ðŸ‘‹


I am a freelance Graphic Designer specializing in brand identity and advertising, as well as a Marketer certified by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing. I have a passion for problem-solving and am currently learning to program through Harvardâ€™s CS50w course (with only the final project remaining) and other online resources. I have also completed CS50x. My main interests are in front-end development and web applications.
